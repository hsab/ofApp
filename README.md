ofApp
=====

Compiling
---------

Make sure that [of](https://github.com/ofnode/of) and ofApp share the same folder.
If that's not the case, you should use `OF_ROOT` CMake variable to tell cmake where to find `of`.
For example : `cmake .. -DOF_ROOT=~/dev/of -G Ninja`

Change directory to ofApp and perform these steps:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja
ninja
```

You can also use your prefered IDE to load the project (Qtcreator for example.)
It's also possible to generate Xcode project with Ninja, this have not been tested though.
